#  READ THIS
# since java is run write once, run anywhare (WORA) if it compiles on inux it compiles everywhere
# if there is a problem in the code, that program shouldnt compile
# if any errors are spit out by javac (compiler) the pipeline will fail because of failOnStderr: true.
# feel free to read the pipeline YAML it is at ```https://github.com/gitcloneguy/Java-Projects/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml```
